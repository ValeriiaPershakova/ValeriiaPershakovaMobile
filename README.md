#Mobile testing Homework 2
This project is the result of mobile testing homework â„–2 and represents native and web applications tests.

###Getting started
You need to install:
1. Appium desktop server
2. Android app bundle
   - Android device emulator
   
###Properties
Tests need appropriate capabilities and variables. Properties files are located in the root of the project (nativetest.properties and webtest.properties) 
+ Common:
  - platform: [ Android | iOS ]
  - driver: appium server URL
- Native tests:
  - aut: absolute path to testing app
  - email | username | password: parameters for new app account
- Web tests:
  - sut: testing site address in format www.[site name].[domain]
  - homePageTitle: expected title of the first open page
  - chromedriver: absolute path to chromedriver for mobile app
  - query: searched word
###Run
1. Set appropriate properties. Make sure your chromedriver version matches Chrome version on your device. (Pre-set version: 79.0.3945.36)
2. Run device emulator
3. Start Appium desktop server
4. Run Maven with desired profile 
###Notes
Native Test ***fails***, because app behaviour does not correspond to common sense.
